Understand SOLID Principles: These principles form the backbone of good design:
*  Single Responsibility Principle: Each class should have only one job.
*   Open/Closed Principle: Code should be open for extension but closed for modification.
*  Liskov Substitution Principle: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass.
*   Interface Segregation Principle: Classes should not be forced to implement interfaces they don't use.
*  Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
